# Search-Directory-and-Binary-Search
The program contains two parts. The first part of the program uses recursion to search for a directory tree. The second part of the program contains two classes-linear search and binary search- that are inherited from the SearchAlgorithm. Then, an appropriate search over an array of strings is facilitated.
